# This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; 
# don’t be thrown off! 
# Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), 
# print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, 
# then skip (don’t print) it. Do this using a WHILE. 
# Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, and excluding the value 9). 

param1 = 3
param2 = 5
param3 = 17
param4 = 9

i = param2
while i <= param3:
    if i % param1 == 0 and i != param4:
        print(i)
    i += 1
